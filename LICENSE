We use libcsv (https://sourceforge.net/projects/libcsv/) to parse CSV files. libcsv
is licensed under the GNU Library or Lesser General Public License version 2.0 (LGPLv2).
So, if you are re-distributing binaries or object files, they may be subject to LGPLv2 terms.
Please ensure that any binaries/object files you distribute are compliant with LGPLv2.
You can disable libcsv usage by not setting the USE_LIBCSV and LIBCSV_DIR flags during compilation.
However, your binaries/executables will not be able to import CSV files into TileDB.
