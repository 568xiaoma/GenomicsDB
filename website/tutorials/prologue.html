                Here you can find various TileDB tutorials. You can navigate from the menu on the 
                left of the page. Below you can find a small description of each tutorial.
            </p>
            
            <h3>TileDB Mechanics 101</h3>
            <p>
                It describes the main concepts of TileDB (such as arrays, tiles, etc.), as well as the
                physical organization of the data in persistent storage. We strongly recommend the 
                user to carefully go through this tutorial prior to using TileDB. This will further facilitate 
                understanding the TileDB executable and APIs, but it will also provide valuable insight into
                how to write super-efficient programs when using TileDB as the underlying array storage manager.
            </p>
            
            <h3>TileDB Installation</h3>
            <p>
                It explains how to download and install TileDB on your system, as well as how to create the C API 
                library and use it with your code.
            </p>
            
            <h3>TileDB Executable</h3>
            <p>
                It provides a thorough walkthrough on how to use the TileDB executable. We strongly recommend the user
                to go through this tutorial immediately after finishing 
                <a href="tiledb_mechanics_101.html" target="tutorial-frame" 
                   onclick='parent.document.getElementById("TileDB-mechanics-101").checked=true;'>TileDB Mechanics 101</a>, as it is essentially
                a hands-on exercise that exposes the TileDB basics.
            </p>
            
            <h3>TileDB C API</h3>
            <p>
                It overviews all the TileDB C API functions, including detailed examples. We strongly recommend the user
                to go through the <a href="tiledb_mechanics_101.html" target="tutorial-frame"
                                     onclick='parent.document.getElementById("TileDB-mechanics-101").checked=true;'>TileDB Mechanics 101</a> 
                and <a href="tiledb_executable.html" target="tutorial-frame"
                       onclick='parent.document.getElementById("TileDB-Executable").checked=true;'>TileDB Executable</a> tutorials, before 
                initiating this tutorial.
            </p>
            
            <h3>TileDB Parallel Programming</h3>
            <p>
                It demonstrates how to write parallel programs while using TileDB as the underlying array
                storage manager. It includes examples of parallel filters and popular Linear Algebra computations.
                This is intended for users that have already mastered the 
                <a href="tiledb_mechanics_101.html" target="tutorial-frame" 
                   onclick='parent.document.getElementById("TileDB-mechanics-101").checked=true;'>TileDB Mechanics 101</a> and 
                <a href="tiledb_c_api.html" target="tutorial-frame"
                   onclick='parent.document.getElementById("TileDB-C-API").checked=true;'>TileDB C API</a> tutorials.
            </p>
            
            <h3>TileDB Implementation</h3>
            <p>
                It provides a deeper dive into the TileDB implementation, such as the most important C++ classes, the
                data structures and algorithms, etc. This is very useful for those interested in becoming TileDB contributors.
